# Alpha+++ Process Discovery Algorithm
This repository contains the Python source code of the Alpha+++ process discovery algorithm.
The evaluation setup is also available, as well as a Jupyter Notebook to visualize, analyze and process evaluation results.

Detailed information on the algorithm and evaluation results on real-life event logs are available separately.

The corresponding paper "__Revisiting the Alpha Algorithm To Enable Real-Life Process Discovery Applications__" was published at the Algorithms & Theories for the Analysis of Event Data (ATAED) 2023 workshop in Caparica, Portugal.
